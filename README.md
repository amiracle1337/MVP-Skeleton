# Production-ready web app to quickly MVP new product ideas

I built a web app skeleton so that whenever I had a problem that I wanted to solve through software, I could quickly insert it into this skeleton and have it in production, ready for users to use.

## Background
I was tired of copy & pasting boiler plate code, and redoing basic functionality that I knew I needed across all my web apps I would build. This skeleton includes proper authentication with forgot and set new password, admin dashboard for full user control, invite-only & waitlist functionaity (perfect for when product is in beta), basic email flows for new users, spotlight search across the entire app, user profile, and much more!

I built the app with the following technologies:

- **Blitz Js**: A full-stack React framework built on Next.js, chosen for its streamlined API integration and enhanced development speed
- **React**: Used as the core library for building the user interface
- **Typescript**: Implemented for static typing and code safety
- **Mantine**: Utilized as our UI component library
- **Railway**: Hosting, for its simplicity and robust production environment
- **Postgres**: Chosen as our relational database 
- **Prisma ORM**: Used as the Database toolkit, simplifying database queries and management
- **Resend**: Integrated for efficient and reliable email delivery to users
- **Zod**: Implemented for runtime data validation, complementing TypeScript's compile-time checks
- **LemonSqueezy**: Integrated lemonSqueezy as payment provider for users to checkout

### Also big shoutout to Kitze, I took a lot of help and inspiration from him to build this.
