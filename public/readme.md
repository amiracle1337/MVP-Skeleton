If you forget how the webhook works in this app:
  You add a new instance of a webhook in the db for a user,
  You add the URL right in the db of the endpoint you wanna ping,
  In the user settings tab -> webhooks now a webhook exists with that URL,
  We have wired up addtodo & deletetodo to to make a post request
